Description:

The Weather Dashboard application is designed to retrieve data from the OpenWeather application API and display a selected city's temperature, wind speed, humidity, UV Index and five-day forecast. In addition, the application will store previously searched city names so that they may be applied to the application again for updated current conditions and a revised forecast.

Instructions of use:

Enter a city name in the box in the upper left hand corner of the page. Select the Submit button and the current conditions and 5-day forecast will be displayed. To see the current conditions and the 5-day forecast from a previously selected city, click on the city and the information will appear to the right side of the screen.
